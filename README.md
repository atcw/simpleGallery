sg - Simple Gallery 
===================

Copyright (C) 2012 Holger Cremer

This is the Simple Gallery php image script. 

It uses many ideas and some code fragmens from the "Bizou - a (french) KISS php image gallery" www.positon.org/bizou/ . 
sg uses the template library Savant3 ( http://phpsavant.com/ ) and the lightbox script Lytebox ( http://lytebox.com/ ).  

Usage:
Just put your images or folder with images in the "images/" folder. You can also add a file named "content.txt" describing your folder.
